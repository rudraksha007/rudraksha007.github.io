Embrace the spirit!Itâ€™s International Yoga Day today.Yoga comes from an ancient land with a deep culture that understands the workings of the human body and the universe. Yoga encompasses the union of the human with the divine, revealing the purpose of life. At Sanskriti KMV School, we recognize the importance of holistic development, and physical well being of our students.
